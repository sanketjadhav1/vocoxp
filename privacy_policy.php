Unless described in this notice, we do not share, sell, rent, or trade any of your information with third parties for their promotional purposes.</li>
        <li><strong>Affiliates.</strong> We may share your information with our affiliates, in which case we will require those affiliates to honor this privacy notice.

    <p>We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider.

No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.</p>

    <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

    <h2>7. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
    <p>In Short: You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.</p>

    <p>If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can find their contact details here: <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm">https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm</a>.</p>

    <h2>8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
    <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (‘DNT’) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>

    <h2>9. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</h2>
